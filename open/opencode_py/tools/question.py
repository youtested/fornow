"""Question tool: the model asks the user structured questions (opencode's).

Mirrors upstream `packages/opencode/src/tool/question.ts`. The run() resolves
the asker lazily from the Registry (like `task`): the owning AgentLoop installs
itself as `registry.question_asker` at construction time so the tool works
headless (no asker -> "user dismissed") and nests naturally.

The parameters/description mirror `question.txt` + the `question.v2` schema.
